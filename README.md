# Fan Status Classification Using Edge Ai with Raspberry Pi Pico
 This project involves using the Raspberry Pi Pico, INA219 current sensor, and MPU6050 IMU sensor to analyze and classify the operational status of a fan. By leveraging Edge Impulse for machine learning, the system can detect anomalies in the fan's operation based on voltage, current, and motion data.
